# Home Assistant Blueprints

This repository contains reusable Home Assistant blueprints for automating lighting behaviors. Blueprints make it easy to share and reuse automation logic in your Home Assistant setup.

## Available Blueprints

- **lighting-dim-off-no-entry.yaml**: Blueprint for dimming and turning off lights with logic that excludes entry detection.
- **lighting-inactivity-dim-off.yaml**: Blueprint for dimming and turning off lights based on inactivity.

## Usage

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Configuration > Blueprints > Import Blueprint**.
2. Paste the raw URL of the YAML file or upload it directly.
3. Create a new automation using the imported blueprint and configure the required inputs.
